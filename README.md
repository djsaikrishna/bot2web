# bot2web2.0
ITS A BOT TO WEB 2.0 REMASTERED VERSION BY ME IT CAN BE USED TO CHECK CCS ON BOT BY RIDIRECTING THEM ON WEB IT HAVE A BETTER SPEED THEN MANUAL CHECK AND SUPPORTS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS


Setup:

3 Telegram Acoounts are needed. It will not work without three accounts

Change values of client1, client2 and client3 with your values you got from my.telegram.org
After you have changed values you can run first_run.py and three terminals will be launched. Login with different accounts just remeber to not mix up phone numbers. c1 terminal is client1, c2 is client2 and c3 is client3
After you have done these stuff you can visit localhost and start using the bot
